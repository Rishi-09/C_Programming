# C_Programming

--This repository is a complete collection of my C programming journey, from beginner-friendly basics to advanced-level coding. Here, you'll find organized, well-documented code snippets, projects, and problem-solving exercises that I have worked on throughout my learning process.
What's Inside?

  1. Basics:
  Variables, data types, constants, and keywords.
  Input/output operations using scanf and printf.
  Control structures: if-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while).
  Operators: arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise.
  
  2. Intermediate:
  
  Functions: declaration, definition, recursion, and scope.
  Arrays and strings: single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and string manipulation.
  Pointers: basics, pointer arithmetic, and pointers with arrays and strings.
  File handling: reading, writing, and working with files.
  Memory management: malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.

  3. Advanced:
  
  Data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
  Advanced algorithms: sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
  Working with macros and preprocessor directives.
  Modular programming and code optimization techniques.
  Building real-world projects using C.
